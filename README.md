# Practical Uncertainty Quantification and Emulator Development in Nuclear Physics
_Materials for the 2023 FRIB-TA summer school_

Welcome to the repository for the 2023 FRIB-TA summer school! This repository contains materials for the whole summer school, but things have been divvied up into subfolders for each session of the program. 

To ease as broad an audience as possible into the wild world of scientific computing and computational statistics we have structured the repository to be easily forked and interacted with via GitHub Codespaces. All you need to do is fork the repository to your own GitHub account and then press the green `Code` button and select codespaces. This will spin up a virtual linux environment for you to run the code examples for the summer school sessions, alleviating the headache of managing your own environment for a three day school.

If you have any difficulties, please ask your questions either in the GitHub issues of this repository or by making a post in the [ASCSN forum](https://forum.ascsn.net) and one of the organizers will respond.
